# Ip Fraud Monitoring Project
## Data Source

The development and validation of this IP monitoring projec were executed **exclusively** using **public** and synthetic data. This methodological constraint ensures the project's absolute independence from any corporate confidential information.

The specific *dataset* utilized is:

* **Title:** Fraud Detection Dataset
* **Author/Creator:** Ziya (Kaggle User)
* **Hosting Platform:** Kaggle Datasets
* **Validation Link:** [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/fraud-detection-dataset)

**Critical Note:** The reliance on this publicly available *dataset* serves as the fundamental evidence that the **genesis and development** of this *framework's* Intellectual Property occurred in an **environment entirely external** to the functional mandate and resources provided by my current employer.
